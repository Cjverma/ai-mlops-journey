# 🧠 AI-MLOps Journey

Welcome to my personal journey from project manager to dangerously competent **AI + MLOps Engineer**. This repo documents everything—from learning Python basics to deploying machine learning models in production like a wizard in Docker armor.

## 🚀 Day 1 Progress

✅ Set up Conda environment  
✅ Installed Python, Jupyter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn  
✅ Ran my first Python script in VS Code  
✅ Initialized Git & pushed to GitHub using Personal Access Token  
✅ Did all of this without previously knowing Git. Who’s unstoppable now?
